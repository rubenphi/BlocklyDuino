## 1. Overview & Key Features

**ESP32Synth** transforms an ESP32 board into a powerful and versatile polyphonic synthesizer. It was built from the ground up for performance, providing low-level control and enabling everything from simple tone generators to complex, evolving, multi-sampled instruments.

*   **Massive Polyphony:** A high-performance mixing engine handles up to **80 simultaneous voices**.
*   **Flexible Audio Output:** Native support for the **internal DAC** (ESP32 classic only), external **I2S DACs** (with 8, 16, and 32-bit depth), and **PDM** digital audio output.
*   **Rich Oscillators:** Core waveforms include Sine, Triangle, Sawtooth, Pulse (with variable width), and Noise.
*   **Wavetable Synthesis:** Use custom wavetables for unique, complex timbres. The engine supports both direct assignment and a memory-efficient registry system for tracker instruments.
*   **Advanced Sampler Engine:** Play PCM audio samples with features like multi-sampling (keyboard zones), pitch shifting, and various loop modes (forward, reverse, ping-pong).
*   **ADSR Envelopes:** A per-voice ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) envelope generator to shape the volume of each note.
*   **Tracker-Style Instruments:** A powerful feature to create intricate, evolving sounds by sequencing different waveforms and volume levels for a note's attack, sustain, and release phases.
*   **Modulation & Effects:** Per-voice Vibrato (pitch LFO), Tremolo (amplitude LFO), Portamento/Slide, and a flexible Arpeggiator.

## 2. Hardware Requirements (Crucial!)

This library was engineered to extract maximum performance from specific ESP32 hardware. Failure to meet these requirements will result in incorrect behavior, audio glitches, or crashes.

*   **CPU: Dual-Core ESP32 Required**
    *   The library's core architecture dedicates an entire CPU core to the real-time audio synthesis task (`audioTask`). This design is fundamental to its glitch-free, non-blocking operation.
    *   **Supported:** **ESP32** (classic) and **ESP32-S3**. Both are dual-core and fully supported for I2S and PDM output.
    *   **Unsupported:** Single-core chips like **ESP32-S2** and **ESP32-C3** are **NOT SUPPORTED**.
    *   **Note on Internal DAC:** The low-fi internal DAC output is **only available on the classic ESP32**, not on the ESP32-S3.

*   **CPU Frequency: 240 MHz Recommended**
    *   **Supported:** The library is tested and performs correctly on ESP32s running at **240 MHz**.
    *   **Unsupported:** Chips running at lower frequencies (e.g., 160 MHz) have **not been tested and are expected to fail**. The real-time audio rendering is CPU-intensive, and a 240 MHz clock speed is required to process the maximum number of voices without missing deadlines, which would cause audible clicks and distortion.

---

## 3. How It Works: Internal Architecture

Understanding the library's design is key to using it effectively.

### The Dual-Core Design
The ESP32's dual-core architecture is the foundation of the synthesizer.
*   **Core 1 (The "Real-Time" Core):** The high-priority `audioTask` is pinned to Core 1. By default, your `setup()` and `loop()` code also run on this core. The audio task's high priority ensures it always runs on time, preempting the `loop()` to prevent any audio glitches. This core handles all time-critical operations.
*   **Core 0 (The "Application" Core):** This core is typically free to run less time-sensitive tasks, most notably the WiFi and Bluetooth stacks. This separation is critical: heavy network activity on Core 0 will not interfere with the audio generation happening on Core 1.

### The Non-Blocking Audio Pipeline
The entire process is non-blocking and managed by DMA.

1.  **`audioTask` Loop:** The task on Core 1 enters an infinite loop.
2.  **`render()` Call:** In each iteration, the loop calls the main `render()` function, requesting a small block of audio samples (e.g., 512 samples).
3.  **Voice Mixing:** The `render()` function iterates through all 80 `Voice` structs. For each active voice, it calculates the next block of samples based on its current frequency, waveform, envelope, and modulators. All active voices are summed into a single **mix buffer**.
4.  **DMA Transfer:** The final mix buffer is handed to the **I2S peripheral** (or DAC driver). A **DMA (Direct Memory Access)** controller then automatically transfers the audio data from the buffer to the physical output pins, sample by sample, without any further CPU involvement.
5.  **Continuous Cycle:** While the DMA is busy sending audio, the `audioTask` is already ahead, working on rendering the *next* block of audio. This producer-consumer model ensures the DMA never runs out of data to send.

### Control Rate vs. Audio Rate
Updating every parameter at the audio sample rate (e.g., 48,000 Hz) would be incredibly inefficient. The library separates these updates:

*   **Audio Rate (e.g., 48,000 Hz):** The core oscillator phase and sample-level mixing happen at the full sample rate inside specialized `renderBlock` functions.
*   **Control Rate (default 100 Hz):** Slower-moving parameters are updated in the `processControl()` function. This includes **LFOs (Vibrato/Tremolo), ADSR envelopes, Arpeggios, and Instrument sequences**. This function runs only 100 times per second by default. The audio rendering functions then interpolate the values between these control points.
    *   You can adjust this with `setControlRateHz()`. A higher rate means smoother modulation at the cost of higher CPU usage.

### Fixed-Point Math & IRAM Optimization
*   **Fixed-Point Arithmetic:** Instead of using slow floating-point numbers (`float`), the entire real-time signal path uses **32-bit fixed-point integers**. For example, frequency is handled in "CentiHz" and phase is managed with a 32-bit accumulator. This avoids the overhead and potential non-determinism of the FPU, which is critical for real-time safety.
*   **`IRAM_ATTR`:** All time-critical functions (`render`, `processControl`, and the various `renderBlock` DSP routines) are marked with `IRAM_ATTR`. This forces the compiler to place them in the ESP32's fast **Internal RAM (IRAM)** instead of slower external Flash memory. This completely eliminates latency from flash cache misses, a common source of audio glitches.

## 5. API Guide

### Initialization: `begin()`
This function configures the hardware and starts the audio engine. Use the overload that matches your hardware.

*   `bool begin(int dacPin);`
    *   **Use Case:** For the **internal DAC** on the classic ESP32 (pin 25 or 26).
    *   **Quality:** Low-fi, but requires no external components. Good for simple beeps and testing.

*   `bool begin(int bckPin, int wsPin, int dataPin);`
    *   **Use Case:** For external **I2S DACs** like the PCM5102A or MAX98357A. Defaults to 16-bit audio.
    *   **Quality:** High-fidelity. The standard for most audio projects.

*   `bool begin(int bckPin, int wsPin, int dataPin, I2S_Depth i2sDepth);`
    *   **Use Case:** For high-resolution I2S DACs. `i2sDepth` can be `I2S_8BIT`, `I2S_16BIT`, or `I2S_32BIT`.
    *   **Quality:** `I2S_32BIT` provides the highest resolution output format.

*   `bool begin(int dataPin, SynthOutputMode mode, int clkPin, int wsPin, I2S_Depth i2sDepth);`
    *   The main, fully-featured initialization function. This is used for all **I2S** and **PDM** (`SMODE_PDM`) outputs.

### Note Control: `noteOn()`, `noteOff()`
This is the primary way to play and stop sounds. The system uses a "gate" model, just like analog synthesizers.

*   `void noteOn(uint8_t voice, uint32_t freqCentiHz, uint8_t volume);`
    *   Triggers a note on a specific `voice` (0-79). This "opens the gate" and starts the **Attack** phase of the ADSR envelope.
    *   `freqCentiHz`: The frequency in hundredths of a Hertz (e.g., `44000` for 440.00 Hz). The `ESP32SynthNotes.h` file provides pre-defined constants like `c4`.
    *   `volume`: The note's velocity or base volume (0-255).

*   `void noteOff(uint8_t voice);`
    *   "Closes the gate" for the specified voice. This **does not stop the sound immediately**. It triggers the **Release** phase of the ADSR envelope, causing the note to fade out smoothly. The voice becomes inactive only after the release phase is complete.

*   `void setFrequency(uint8_t voice, uint32_t freqCentiHz);`
    *   Changes the frequency of an already-playing voice.

*   `void setVolume(uint8_t voice, uint8_t volume);`
    *   Changes the base volume of an already-playing voice.

### Oscillators: `setWave()`, `setPulseWidth()`

*   `void setWave(uint8_t voice, WaveType type);`
    *   Sets the fundamental waveform for a voice's oscillator.
    *   `WaveType`: `WAVE_SINE`, `WAVE_TRIANGLE`, `WAVE_SAW`, `WAVE_PULSE`, `WAVE_NOISE`, `WAVE_WAVETABLE`, `WAVE_SAMPLE`.

*   `void setPulseWidth(uint8_t voice, uint8_t width);`
    *   For `WAVE_PULSE` only. Controls the duty cycle of the pulse wave.
    *   `width`: 0-255. A value of `128` is a 50% duty cycle (a perfect square wave). Changing this value alters the harmonic content, a technique known as Pulse Width Modulation (PWM).

### Wavetables: `setWavetable()`, `registerWavetable()`
Wavetables are arrays containing a single cycle of a custom waveform.

*   `void setWavetable(uint8_t voice, const void* data, uint32_t size, BitDepth depth);`
    *   Assigns a wavetable directly to a single voice.
    *   `data`: Pointer to the array of sample data.
    *   `size`: The number of samples in the array.
    *   `depth`: The bit depth of the data (`BITS_8` or `BITS_16`).

*   `void registerWavetable(uint16_t id, const void* data, uint32_t size, BitDepth depth);`
    *   Registers a wavetable in a global lookup table with a unique `id` (0-999). This is the required method for using wavetables with **Tracker-Style Instruments**. It is highly memory-efficient as the wavetable is stored only once and referenced by its ID.

### Envelopes (ADSR): `setEnv()`

*   `void setEnv(uint8_t voice, uint16_t a, uint16_t d, uint8_t s, uint16_t r);`
    *   Defines the volume contour for a voice.
    *   `a` (Attack): Time in milliseconds for the volume to go from 0 to max.
    *   `d` (Decay): Time in ms for the volume to fall from max to the sustain level.
    *   `s` (Sustain): The volume level (0-255) held as long as the note is on.
    *   `r` (Release): Time in ms for the volume to fall from the sustain level to 0 after `noteOff()` is called.

### Sampler Engine: `registerSample()`, `Instrument_Sample`
The sampler can play back pre-recorded PCM audio.

**Workflow:**
1.  **Convert Audio:** Use the `WavToEsp32SynthConverter.py` script in the `tools` folder to convert a `.wav` file into a `.h` header file.
2.  **Register Sample:**
    `void registerSample(uint16_t id, const int16_t* data, uint32_t length, uint32_t sampleRate, uint32_t rootFreqCentiHz);`
    *   In your `setup()`, call this to load the sample data from the header file into the synth's registry.
    *   `id`: A unique ID (0-99) for this sample.
    *   `rootFreqCentiHz`: The original pitch of the sample (e.g., `c4`). This is crucial for correct pitch shifting.
3.  **Define Zones:**
    An `Instrument_Sample` uses an array of `SampleZone` structs to map frequency ranges to specific samples. This allows for creating multi-sampled instruments (e.g., a different piano sample for every octave).
    ```cpp
    // This zone maps all frequencies to sample ID 0.
    const SampleZone singleZone[] = {{ .lowFreq = 0, .highFreq = 1300000, .sampleId = 0 }};
    ```
4.  **Create Instrument:**
    ```cpp
    Instrument_Sample mySampler = {
      .zones = singleZone,
      .numZones = 1,
      .loopMode = LOOP_FORWARD, // LOOP_OFF, LOOP_PINGPONG, LOOP_REVERSE
      .loopStart = 1000,
      .loopEnd = 5000
    };
    ```
5.  **Assign and Play:**
    `void setInstrument(uint8_t voice, Instrument_Sample* inst);`
    *   Use this function to attach the sampler instrument to a voice, then use `noteOn()` to play it. The frequency passed to `noteOn()` will determine the playback pitch.

### Raw Sample Control
For situations requiring direct, dynamic control over sample playback without the overhead of the `Instrument_Sample` structure, you can use the raw control functions. This is ideal for tasks like building drum machines where you want to trigger different samples on the same voice quickly or create complex loops on the fly.

This method still requires the sample to be registered first using `registerSample()`.

*   `void setSample(uint8_t voice, uint16_t sampleId, LoopMode loopMode = LOOP_OFF, uint32_t loopStart = 0, uint32_t loopEnd = 0);`
    *   Directly assigns a registered sample to a voice and sets its playback properties.
    *   Calling this function detaches any existing `Instrument_Sample` from the voice.
    *   `sampleId`: The ID of the sample you previously registered.
    *   `loopMode`: Sets the loop behavior (`LOOP_OFF`, `LOOP_FORWARD`, `LOOP_PINGPONG`, `LOOP_REVERSE`).
    *   `loopStart`/`loopEnd`: Defines the loop region in samples. `loopEnd = 0` means the end of the sample.

*   `void setSampleLoop(uint8_t voice, LoopMode loopMode, uint32_t loopStart, uint32_t loopEnd);`
    *   Allows you to change the loop parameters of a voice *while it is playing a sample*.
    *   This is powerful for dynamically altering loops without re-triggering the note.

### Tracker-Style Instruments: `Instrument`
This advanced feature allows a single note to trigger a sequence of different timbres and volumes. This is perfect for creating percussive hits, laser zaps, or evolving pads.

The `Instrument` struct contains pointers to arrays that define the sequences for the attack and release phases.

```cpp
// Example: A kick drum sound
// Attack: Starts with a noisy "click", then a quick sine wave pitch drop.
const int16_t kick_attack_waves[] = { W_NOISE, W_SINE };
const uint8_t kick_attack_vols[]  = { 255, 127 };

Instrument kickInstrument = {
  .seqVolumes = kick_attack_vols,
  .seqWaves = kick_attack_waves,
  .seqLen = 2,
  .seqSpeedMs = 20, // Each step is 20ms

  .susVol = 0,         // No sound during sustain
  .susWave = W_SINE,

  .relLen = 0 // No release phase
};
```
To use it, assign it with `setInstrument(voice, &kickInstrument)` and trigger it with `noteOn()`.

*   `void detachInstrumentAndSetWave(uint8_t voice, WaveType type);`
    *   A utility function to remove any assigned Instrument (Tracker or Sampler) from a voice and set it back to a basic waveform. This is essential for safely re-using voices in a polyphonic setup.

### Modulation & Effects

*   `void setVibrato(uint8_t voice, uint32_t rateCentiHz, uint32_t depthCentiHz);`
    *   Adds a pitch LFO (vibrato). `depthCentiHz` controls the amount of pitch deviation.

*   `void setTremolo(uint8_t voice, uint32_t rateCentiHz, uint16_t depth);`
    *   Adds an amplitude LFO (tremolo). `depth` is the intensity from 0-255.

*   `void slideTo(uint8_t voice, uint32_t endFreqCentiHz, uint32_t durationMs);`
    *   Slides the pitch of a voice from its current frequency to a target frequency over a set duration.

*   `void setArpeggio(uint8_t voice, uint16_t durationMs, Args... freqs);`
    *   A template function to create a sequence of notes. When you call `noteOn()` on this voice, it will automatically cycle through the `freqs` provided, with each note lasting `durationMs`.
    ```cpp
    // Create a C-minor arpeggio
    synth.setArpeggio(0, 150, c4, ds4, g4, c5);
    synth.noteOn(0, c4, 255); // Trigger the arpeggio
    ```

### Getters & Status

*   `bool isVoiceActive(uint8_t voice);`
    *   Returns `true` if the voice is currently playing (i.e., not in the `ENV_IDLE` state). Useful for finding a free voice.

*   `uint8_t getOutput8Bit(uint8_t voice);`
    *   Returns the current final output level of a voice (0-255), after volume and envelope have been applied. Useful for "voice stealing" logic or creating visualizations.

### Utilities: `ESP32SynthNotes.h`
The library includes `ESP32SynthNotes.h`, which provides:
*   Pre-defined constants for note frequencies in CentiHz (e.g., `c4`, `fs5`, `a4`).
*   An inline helper function `midiToFreq(uint8_t note)` to convert a standard MIDI note number (0-127) to the corresponding frequency in CentiHz.

---

## 6. Voice Management for Polyphony

The library gives you full control over the 80 voices but does **not** automatically allocate them. You must implement your own logic to find a free voice to play a new note. A common strategy is "voice stealing."

```cpp
int findFreeVoice() {
  // 1. Find the first completely inactive voice.
  for (int i = 0; i < MAX_VOICES; i++) {
    if (!synth.isVoiceActive(i)) {
      return i;
    }
  }

  // 2. If all voices are active, find the quietest one to "steal".
  // This is likely a voice in its release phase.
  uint8_t lowestVol = 255;
  int quietestVoice = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < MAX_VOICES; i++) {
    uint8_t vol = synth.getOutput8Bit(i);
    if (vol < lowestVol) {
      lowestVol = vol;
      quietestVoice = i;
    }
  }
  return quietestVoice;
}
```

---

## 7. Included Tools

The `tools` directory contains helpful Python scripts:

*   `tools/Wavetables/WavetableMaker.py`: Generates wavetables from various sources.
*   `tools/Samples/WavToEsp32SynthConverter.py`: Converts standard `.wav` files into `.h` header files compatible with the sampler engine.

---

## 8. Troubleshooting

*   **Audio has clicks, pops, or distortion:**
    1.  **Check Hardware Requirements:** Ensure you are using a supported dual-core, 240 MHz ESP32.
    2.  **Power Supply:** Use a clean 3.3V power source. Noise on the power rail is a very common cause of bad audio.
    3.  **I2S Wiring:** Keep I2S wires (BCK, WS, DATA) as short as possible and ensure a solid GND connection between the ESP32 and your DAC.
    4.  **Amplifier:** The output of a DAC is line-level. **Do not connect it directly to a speaker.** You need an external amplifier.

*   **ESP32 crashes or reboots (Watchdog Timer) and using `delay()`:**
    *   Because the audio synthesis runs in a separate, high-priority task (`audioTask`) pinned to Core 1, using the standard Arduino `delay()` function in your `loop()` **will not cause audio glitches or stuttering**. The FreeRTOS scheduler will ensure the `audioTask` always gets CPU time.
    *   You can use `delay()` without problems for simple applications. However, be aware that very long delays (many seconds) can still potentially trigger the ESP32's Task Watchdog Timer (TWDT), which can cause a reboot. For complex applications that need to remain responsive, it is still good practice to use non-blocking timers with `millis()`.

*   **Compilation errors about `i2s` or `dac` functions:**
    *   Your ESP32 board support package in the Arduino IDE is likely outdated. Update it via the Boards Manager.

## Advanced Usage: Wavetable Memory Management

A critical detail when working with wavetables is understanding the difference between the number of samples and the size of the data array in bytes. The `setWavetable()` and `registerWavetable()` functions expect the `size` parameter to be the **number of individual samples** in the waveform, not the byte size of the array.

When using C++'s `sizeof()` operator, you get the total size of the array in bytes. To get the correct number of samples, you must adjust this value based on the wavetable's bit depth.

### `BITS_16` (16-bit wavetables)
Each sample is an `int16_t`, which takes up 2 bytes. To get the number of samples, you must **divide by 2**.

```cpp
// A 16-bit wavetable with 256 samples occupies 512 bytes.
const int16_t my_wave_16bit[256] = { ... };

// Correct usage:
synth.setWavetable(0, my_wave_16bit, sizeof(my_wave_16bit) / 2, BITS_16);
```

### `BITS_8` (8-bit wavetables)
Each sample is a `uint8_t`, which takes up 1 byte. The number of samples is equal to the size in bytes.

```cpp
// An 8-bit wavetable with 256 samples occupies 256 bytes.
const uint8_t my_wave_8bit[256] = { ... };

// Correct usage:
synth.setWavetable(0, my_wave_8bit, sizeof(my_wave_8bit), BITS_8);
```

### `BITS_4` (4-bit wavetables)
4-bit samples are packed, with **two samples stored in a single `uint8_t`**. To get the total number of samples, you must **multiply by 2**.

```cpp
// A 4-bit wavetable with 256 samples occupies 128 bytes.
const uint8_t my_wave_4bit[128] = { ... };

// Correct usage:
synth.setWavetable(0, my_wave_4bit, sizeof(my_wave_4bit) * 2, BITS_4);
```
The `WavetableMaker.py` tool now automatically generates example code that uses the correct `sizeof()` logic.

## Uso Avançado: Gerenciamento de Memória de Wavetables

Um detalhe crítico ao trabalhar com wavetables é entender a diferença entre o número de amostras (samples) e o tamanho do array de dados em bytes. As funções `setWavetable()` e `registerWavetable()` esperam que o parâmetro `size` seja o **número de amostras individuais** na forma de onda, e não o tamanho do array em bytes.

Ao usar o operador `sizeof()` do C++, você obtém o tamanho total do array em bytes. Para obter o número correto de amostras, você deve ajustar esse valor com base na profundidade de bits (bit depth) da wavetable.

### `BITS_16` (wavetables de 16-bit)
Cada amostra é um `int16_t`, que ocupa 2 bytes. Para obter o número de amostras, você deve **dividir por 2**.

```cpp
// Uma wavetable de 16-bit com 256 amostras ocupa 512 bytes.
const int16_t my_wave_16bit[256] = { ... };

// Uso correto:
synth.setWavetable(0, my_wave_16bit, sizeof(my_wave_16bit) / 2, BITS_16);
```

### `BITS_8` (wavetables de 8-bit)
Cada amostra é um `uint8_t`, que ocupa 1 byte. O número de amostras é igual ao tamanho em bytes.

```cpp
// Uma wavetable de 8-bit com 256 amostras ocupa 256 bytes.
const uint8_t my_wave_8bit[256] = { ... };

// Uso correto:
synth.setWavetable(0, my_wave_8bit, sizeof(my_wave_8bit), BITS_8);
```

### `BITS_4` (wavetables de 4-bit)
As amostras de 4-bit são compactadas, com **duas amostras armazenadas em um único `uint8_t`**. Para obter o número total de amostras, você deve **multiplicar por 2**.

```cpp
// Uma wavetable de 4-bit com 256 amostras ocupa 128 bytes.
const uint8_t my_wave_4bit[128] = { ... };

// Uso correto:
synth.setWavetable(0, my_wave_4bit, sizeof(my_wave_4bit) * 2, BITS_4);
```
A ferramenta `WavetableMaker.py` agora gera automaticamente o código de exemplo que utiliza a lógica `sizeof()` correta.

## 1. Visão Geral e Recursos Principais

O **ESP32Synth** transforma uma placa ESP32 em um sintetizador polifônico poderoso e versátil. Ele foi construído do zero para performance, fornecendo controle de baixo nível e permitindo desde simples geradores de tom até instrumentos complexos, multi-sampleados e em evolução.

*   **Polifonia Massiva:** Um motor de mixagem de alta performance gerencia até **80 vozes simultâneas**.
*   **Saída de Áudio Flexível:** Suporte nativo para o **DAC interno** (apenas ESP32 clássico), **DACs I2S** externos (com profundidade de 8, 16 e 32 bits) e saída de áudio digital **PDM**.
*   **Osciladores Ricos:** Formas de onda principais incluem Senoidal, Triangular, Dente de Serra, Pulso (com largura variável) e Ruído.
*   **Síntese Wavetable:** Use wavetables customizadas para timbres únicos e complexos. O motor suporta tanto atribuição direta quanto um sistema de registro eficiente em memória para instrumentos de tracker.
*   **Motor de Sampler Avançado:** Reproduza amostras de áudio PCM com recursos como multi-sampling (zonas de teclado), pitch shifting e vários modos de loop (forward, reverse, ping-pong).
*   **Envelopes ADSR:** Um gerador de envelope ADSR (Attack, Decay, Sustain, Release) por voz para modelar o volume de cada nota.
*   **Instrumentos Estilo Tracker:** Um recurso poderoso para criar sons intrincados e evolutivos, sequenciando diferentes formas de onda e níveis de volume para as fases de ataque, sustentação e relaxamento de uma nota.
*   **Modulação e Efeitos:** Vibrato (LFO de pitch), Tremolo (LFO de amplitude), Portamento/Slide e um Arpejador flexível por voz.

## 2. Requisitos de Hardware (Crucial!)

Esta biblioteca foi projetada para extrair o máximo de performance de hardware ESP32 específico. O não cumprimento desses requisitos resultará em comportamento incorreto, falhas de áudio ou travamentos.

*   **CPU: Requer ESP32 Dual-Core**
    *   A arquitetura central da biblioteca dedica um núcleo de CPU inteiro à tarefa de síntese de áudio em tempo real (`audioTask`). Este design é fundamental para sua operação sem falhas e não-bloqueante.
    *   **Suportado:** **ESP32** (clássico) e **ESP32-S3**. Ambos são dual-core e totalmente suportados para saída I2S e PDM.
    *   **Não Suportado:** Chips single-core como **ESP32-S2** e **ESP32-C3** **NÃO SÃO SUPORTADOS**.
    *   **Nota sobre o DAC Interno:** A saída de baixa fidelidade do DAC interno está **disponível apenas no ESP32 clássico**, não no ESP32-S3.

*   **Frequência da CPU: 240 MHz Recomendado**
    *   **Suportado:** A biblioteca é testada e funciona corretamente em ESP32s operando a **240 MHz**.
    *   **Não Suportado:** Chips operando em frequências mais baixas (ex: 160 MHz) **não foram testados e a expectativa é que falhem**. A renderização de áudio em tempo real é intensiva em CPU, e uma velocidade de clock de 240 MHz é necessária para processar o número máximo de vozes sem perder prazos, o que causaria cliques e distorção audíveis.

---

## 3. Como Funciona: Arquitetura Interna

Entender o design da biblioteca é fundamental para usá-la de forma eficaz.

### O Design Dual-Core
A arquitetura dual-core do ESP32 é a base do sintetizador.
*   **Core 1 (O Núcleo de "Tempo Real"):** A tarefa de alta prioridade `audioTask` é fixada no Core 1. Por padrão, seu código `setup()` e `loop()` também roda neste núcleo. A alta prioridade da tarefa de áudio garante que ela sempre execute no tempo certo, tomando a frente do `loop()` para prevenir falhas no áudio. Este núcleo gerencia todas as operações críticas em tempo.
*   **Core 0 (O Núcleo de "Aplicação"):** Este núcleo geralmente fica livre para executar tarefas menos sensíveis ao tempo, principalmente as pilhas de WiFi e Bluetooth. Essa separação é crítica: atividades de rede pesadas no Core 0 não interferirão na geração de áudio que acontece no Core 1.

### O Pipeline de Áudio Não-Bloqueante
Todo o processo é não-bloqueante e gerenciado por DMA.

1.  **Loop da `audioTask`:** A tarefa no Core 1 entra em um loop infinito.
2.  **Chamada de `render()`:** Em cada iteração, o loop chama a função principal `render()`, solicitando um pequeno bloco de amostras de áudio (ex: 512 amostras).
3.  **Mixagem de Vozes:** A função `render()` itera por todas as 80 estruturas `Voice`. Para cada voz ativa, ela calcula o próximo bloco de amostras com base em sua frequência, forma de onda, envelope e moduladores atuais. Todas as vozes ativas são somadas em um único **buffer de mixagem**.
4.  **Transferência DMA:** O buffer de mixagem final é entregue ao **periférico I2S** (ou driver DAC). Um controlador **DMA (Direct Memory Access)** então transfere automaticamente os dados de áudio do buffer para os pinos de saída físicos, amostra por amostra, sem qualquer envolvimento adicional da CPU.
5.  **Ciclo Contínuo:** Enquanto o DMA está ocupado enviando o áudio, a `audioTask` já está à frente, trabalhando na renderização do *próximo* bloco de áudio. Este modelo produtor-consumidor garante que o DMA nunca fique sem dados para enviar.

### Taxa de Controle vs. Taxa de Áudio
Atualizar todos os parâmetros na taxa de amostragem de áudio (ex: 48.000 Hz) seria incrivelmente ineficiente. A biblioteca separa essas atualizações:

*   **Taxa de Áudio (ex: 48.000 Hz):** A fase do oscilador principal e a mixagem em nível de amostra acontecem na taxa de amostragem completa dentro de funções `renderBlock` especializadas.
*   **Taxa de Controle (padrão 100 Hz):** Parâmetros de movimento mais lento são atualizados na função `processControl()`. Isso inclui **LFOs (Vibrato/Tremolo), envelopes ADSR, Arpejos e sequências de Instrumentos**. Esta função roda apenas 100 vezes por segundo por padrão. As funções de renderização de áudio então interpolam os valores entre esses pontos de controle.
    *   Você pode ajustar isso com `setControlRateHz()`. Uma taxa maior significa modulação mais suave ao custo de maior uso da CPU.

### Aritmética de Ponto Fixo e Otimização de IRAM
*   **Aritmética de Ponto Fixo:** Em vez de usar números de ponto flutuante lentos (`float`), todo o caminho do sinal em tempo real usa **inteiros de ponto fixo de 32 bits**. Por exemplo, a frequência é tratada em "CentiHz" e a fase é gerenciada com um acumulador de 32 bits. Isso evita a sobrecarga e a potencial não-determinismo da FPU, que é crítico para a segurança em tempo real.
*   **`IRAM_ATTR`:** Todas as funções críticas em tempo (`render`, `processControl` e as várias rotinas DSP `renderBlock`) são marcadas com `IRAM_ATTR`. Isso força o compilador a colocá-las na rápida **RAM Interna (IRAM)** do ESP32, em vez da memória Flash externa mais lenta. Isso elimina completamente a latência de cache misses da flash, uma fonte comum de falhas de áudio.

---

## 5. Guia da API

### Inicialização: `begin()`
Esta função configura o hardware e inicia o motor de áudio. Use a sobrecarga que corresponde ao seu hardware.

*   `bool begin(int dacPin);`
    *   **Caso de Uso:** Para o **DAC interno** no ESP32 clássico (pino 25 ou 26).
    *   **Qualidade:** Baixa-fidelidade, mas não requer componentes externos. Bom para bipes simples e testes.

*   `bool begin(int bckPin, int wsPin, int dataPin);`
    *   **Caso de Uso:** Para **DACs I2S** externos como o PCM5102A ou MAX98357A. O padrão é áudio de 16 bits.
    *   **Qualidade:** Alta-fidelidade. O padrão para a maioria dos projetos de áudio.

*   `bool begin(int bckPin, int wsPin, int dataPin, I2S_Depth i2sDepth);`
    *   **Caso de Uso:** Para DACs I2S de alta resolução. `i2sDepth` pode ser `I2S_8BIT`, `I2S_16BIT` ou `I2S_32BIT`.
    *   **Qualidade:** `I2S_32BIT` fornece o formato de saída de maior resolução.

*   `bool begin(int dataPin, SynthOutputMode mode, int clkPin, int wsPin, I2S_Depth i2sDepth);`
    *   A função de inicialização principal e completa. É usada para todas as saídas **I2S** e **PDM** (`SMODE_PDM`).

### Controle de Notas: `noteOn()`, `noteOff()`
Esta é a maneira principal de tocar e parar sons. O sistema usa um modelo de "gate", assim como os sintetizadores analógicos.

*   `void noteOn(uint8_t voice, uint32_t freqCentiHz, uint8_t volume);`
    *   Dispara uma nota em uma `voice` específica (0-79). Isso "abre o gate" e inicia a fase de **Attack** do envelope ADSR.
    *   `freqCentiHz`: A frequência em centésimos de Hertz (ex: `44000` para 440.00 Hz). O arquivo `ESP32SynthNotes.h` fornece constantes pré-definidas como `c4`.
    *   `volume`: A velocidade ou volume base da nota (0-255).

*   `void noteOff(uint8_t voice);`
    *   "Fecha o gate" para a voz especificada. Isso **não para o som imediatamente**. Ele dispara a fase de **Release** do envelope ADSR, fazendo com que a nota desapareça suavemente. A voz só se torna inativa após a conclusão da fase de release.

*   `void setFrequency(uint8_t voice, uint32_t freqCentiHz);`
    *   Altera a frequência de uma voz que já está tocando.

*   `void setVolume(uint8_t voice, uint8_t volume);`
    *   Altera o volume base de uma voz que já está tocando.

### Osciladores: `setWave()`, `setPulseWidth()`

*   `void setWave(uint8_t voice, WaveType type);`
    *   Define a forma de onda fundamental para o oscilador de uma voz.
    *   `WaveType`: `WAVE_SINE`, `WAVE_TRIANGLE`, `WAVE_SAW`, `WAVE_PULSE`, `WAVE_NOISE`, `WAVE_WAVETABLE`, `WAVE_SAMPLE`.

*   `void setPulseWidth(uint8_t voice, uint8_t width);`
    *   Apenas para `WAVE_PULSE`. Controla o ciclo de trabalho da onda de pulso.
    *   `width`: 0-255. Um valor de `128` é um ciclo de trabalho de 50% (uma onda quadrada perfeita). Alterar este valor modifica o conteúdo harmônico, uma técnica conhecida como Modulação por Largura de Pulso (PWM).

### Wavetables: `setWavetable()`, `registerWavetable()`
Wavetables são arrays contendo um único ciclo de uma forma de onda personalizada.

*   `void setWavetable(uint8_t voice, const void* data, uint32_t size, BitDepth depth);`
    *   Atribui uma wavetable diretamente a uma única voz.
    *   `data`: Ponteiro para o array de dados da amostra.
    *   `size`: O número de amostras no array.
    *   `depth`: A profundidade de bits dos dados (`BITS_8` ou `BITS_16`).

*   `void registerWavetable(uint16_t id, const void* data, uint32_t size, BitDepth depth);`
    *   Registra uma wavetable em uma tabela de pesquisa global com um `id` único (0-999). Este é o método necessário para usar wavetables com **Instrumentos Estilo Tracker**. É altamente eficiente em memória, pois a wavetable é armazenada apenas uma vez e referenciada pelo seu ID.

### Envelopes (ADSR): `setEnv()`

*   `void setEnv(uint8_t voice, uint16_t a, uint16_t d, uint8_t s, uint16_t r);`
    *   Define o contorno de volume para uma voz.
    *   `a` (Attack): Tempo em milissegundos para o volume ir de 0 ao máximo.
    *   `d` (Decay): Tempo em ms para o volume cair do máximo até o nível de sustain.
    *   `s` (Sustain): O nível de volume (0-255) mantido enquanto a nota está ligada.
    *   `r` (Release): Tempo em ms para o volume cair do nível de sustain para 0 após `noteOff()` ser chamado.

### Motor de Sampler: `registerSample()`, `Instrument_Sample`
O sampler pode reproduzir áudio PCM pré-gravado.

**Fluxo de trabalho:**
1.  **Converter Áudio:** Use o script `WavToEsp32SynthConverter.py` na pasta `tools` para converter um arquivo `.wav` em um arquivo de cabeçalho `.h`.
2.  **Registrar Amostra:**
    `void registerSample(uint16_t id, const int16_t* data, uint32_t length, uint32_t sampleRate, uint32_t rootFreqCentiHz);`
    *   Em seu `setup()`, chame isso para carregar os dados da amostra do arquivo de cabeçalho no registro do sintetizador.
    *   `id`: Um ID único (0-99) para esta amostra.
    *   `rootFreqCentiHz`: O tom original da amostra (ex: `c4`). Isso é crucial para o pitch shifting correto.
3.  **Definir Zonas:**
    Um `Instrument_Sample` usa um array de `SampleZone` para mapear faixas de frequência para amostras específicas. Isso permite a criação de instrumentos multi-sampleados (ex: uma amostra de piano diferente para cada oitava).
    ```cpp
    // Esta zona mapeia todas as frequências para a amostra ID 0.
    const SampleZone singleZone[] = {{ .lowFreq = 0, .highFreq = 1300000, .sampleId = 0 }};
    ```
4.  **Criar Instrumento:**
    ```cpp
    Instrument_Sample mySampler = {
      .zones = singleZone,
      .numZones = 1,
      .loopMode = LOOP_FORWARD, // LOOP_OFF, LOOP_PINGPONG, LOOP_REVERSE
      .loopStart = 1000,
      .loopEnd = 5000
    };
    ```
5.  **Atribuir e Tocar:**
    `void setInstrument(uint8_t voice, Instrument_Sample* inst);`
    *   Use esta função para anexar o instrumento sampler a uma voz, depois use `noteOn()` para tocá-lo. A frequência passada para `noteOn()` determinará o tom de reprodução.

### Controle Bruto de Samples
Para situações que exigem controle direto e dinâmico sobre a reprodução de samples sem a sobrecarga da estrutura `Instrument_Sample`, você pode usar as funções de controle bruto. Isso é ideal para tarefas como a construção de baterias eletrônicas, onde você deseja disparar diferentes samples na mesma voz rapidamente ou criar loops complexos dinamicamente.

Este método ainda exige que o sample seja registrado primeiro usando `registerSample()`.

*   `void setSample(uint8_t voice, uint16_t sampleId, LoopMode loopMode = LOOP_OFF, uint32_t loopStart = 0, uint32_t loopEnd = 0);`
    *   Atribui diretamente um sample registrado a uma voz e define suas propriedades de reprodução.
    *   Chamar esta função desvincula qualquer `Instrument_Sample` existente da voz.
    *   `sampleId`: O ID do sample que você registrou anteriormente.
    *   `loopMode`: Define o comportamento do loop (`LOOP_OFF`, `LOOP_FORWARD`, `LOOP_PINGPONG`, `LOOP_REVERSE`).
    *   `loopStart`/`loopEnd`: Define a região de loop em amostras. `loopEnd = 0` significa o final do sample.

*   `void setSampleLoop(uint8_t voice, LoopMode loopMode, uint32_t loopStart, uint32_t loopEnd);`
    *   Permite que você altere os parâmetros de loop de uma voz *enquanto ela está tocando um sample*.
    *   Isso é poderoso para alterar loops dinamicamente sem precisar redisparar a nota.

### Instrumentos Estilo Tracker: `Instrument`
Este recurso avançado permite que uma única nota dispare uma sequência de diferentes timbres e volumes. É perfeito para criar batidas percussivas, sons de laser ou pads evolutivos.

A estrutura `Instrument` contém ponteiros para arrays que definem as sequências para as fases de ataque e release.

```cpp
// Exemplo: Um som de bumbo
// Ataque: Começa com um "clique" ruidoso, depois uma queda rápida de tom com uma onda senoidal.
const int16_t kick_attack_waves[] = { W_NOISE, W_SINE };
const uint8_t kick_attack_vols[]  = { 255, 127 };

Instrument kickInstrument = {
  .seqVolumes = kick_attack_vols,
  .seqWaves = kick_attack_waves,
  .seqLen = 2,
  .seqSpeedMs = 20, // Cada passo dura 20ms

  .susVol = 0,         // Sem som durante a sustentação
  .susWave = W_SINE,

  .relLen = 0 // Sem fase de release
};
```
Para usar, atribua-o com `setInstrument(voice, &kickInstrument)` e dispare-o com `noteOn()`.

*   `void detachInstrumentAndSetWave(uint8_t voice, WaveType type);`
    *   Uma função utilitária para remover qualquer Instrumento (Tracker ou Sampler) de uma voz e redefini-la para uma forma de onda básica. Essencial para reutilizar vozes com segurança em um setup polifônico.

### Modulação e Efeitos

*   `void setVibrato(uint8_t voice, uint32_t rateCentiHz, uint32_t depthCentiHz);`
    *   Adiciona um LFO de pitch (vibrato). `depthCentiHz` controla a quantidade de desvio de tom.

*   `void setTremolo(uint8_t voice, uint32_t rateCentiHz, uint16_t depth);`
    *   Adiciona um LFO de amplitude (tremolo). `depth` é a intensidade de 0-255.

*   `void slideTo(uint8_t voice, uint32_t endFreqCentiHz, uint32_t durationMs);`
    *   Desliza o tom de uma voz de sua frequência atual para uma frequência alvo ao longo de uma duração definida.

*   `void setArpeggio(uint8_t voice, uint16_t durationMs, Args... freqs);`
    *   Uma função de template para criar uma sequência de notas. Quando você chama `noteOn()` nesta voz, ela irá ciclar automaticamente através das `freqs` fornecidas, com cada nota durando `durationMs`.
    ```cpp
    // Cria um arpejo de Dó menor
    synth.setArpeggio(0, 150, c4, ds4, g4, c5);
    synth.noteOn(0, c4, 255); // Dispara o arpejo
    ```

### Getters e Status

*   `bool isVoiceActive(uint8_t voice);`
    *   Retorna `true` se a voz estiver tocando atualmente (ou seja, não no estado `ENV_IDLE`). Útil para encontrar uma voz livre.

*   `uint8_t getOutput8Bit(uint8_t voice);`
    *   Retorna o nível de saída final atual de uma voz (0-255), após a aplicação de volume e envelope. Útil para lógica de "roubo de voz" ou para criar visualizações.

### Utilitários: `ESP32SynthNotes.h`
A biblioteca inclui `ESP32SynthNotes.h`, que fornece:
*   Constantes pré-definidas para frequências de notas em CentiHz (ex: `c4`, `fs5`, `a4`).
*   Uma função de ajuda inline `midiToFreq(uint8_t note)` para converter um número de nota MIDI padrão (0-127) para a frequência correspondente em CentiHz.

## 6. Gerenciamento de Vozes para Polifonia

A biblioteca lhe dá controle total sobre as 80 vozes, mas **não** as aloca automaticamente. Você deve implementar sua própria lógica para encontrar uma voz livre para tocar uma nova nota. Uma estratégia comum é o "roubo de voz".

```cpp
int findFreeVoice() {
  // 1. Encontra a primeira voz completamente inativa.
  for (int i = 0; i < MAX_VOICES; i++) {
    if (!synth.isVoiceActive(i)) {
      return i;
    }
  }

  // 2. Se todas as vozes estiverem ativas, encontre a mais silenciosa para "roubar".
  // Provavelmente será uma voz em sua fase de release.
  uint8_t lowestVol = 255;
  int quietestVoice = 0;
  for (int i = 0; i < MAX_VOICES; i++) {
    uint8_t vol = synth.getOutput8Bit(i);
    if (vol < lowestVol) {
      lowestVol = vol;
      quietestVoice = i;
    }
  }
  return quietestVoice;
}
```

## 7. Ferramentas Inclusas

O diretório `tools` contém scripts Python úteis:

*   `tools/Wavetables/WavetableMaker.py`: Gera wavetables a partir de várias fontes.
*   `tools/Samples/WavToEsp32SynthConverter.py`: Converte arquivos `.wav` padrão em arquivos de cabeçalho `.h` compatíveis com o motor de sampler.

---

## 8. Solução de Problemas

*   **Áudio tem cliques, estalos ou distorção:**
    1.  **Verifique os Requisitos de Hardware:** Certifique-se de que está usando um ESP32 dual-core de 240 MHz suportado.
    2.  **Fonte de Alimentação:** Use uma fonte de alimentação limpa de 3.3V. Ruído na linha de alimentação é uma causa muito comum de áudio ruim.
    3.  **Fiação I2S:** Mantenha os fios I2S (BCK, WS, DATA) o mais curtos possível e garanta uma conexão GND sólida entre o ESP32 e seu DAC.
    4.  **Amplificador:** A saída de um DAC é de nível de linha. **Não a conecte diretamente a um alto-falante.** Você precisa de um amplificador externo.

*   **ESP32 trava ou reinicia (Watchdog Timer) e uso de `delay()`:**
    *   Como a síntese de áudio roda em uma tarefa separada de alta prioridade (`audioTask`) fixada no Core 1, usar a função `delay()` padrão do Arduino no seu `loop()` **não causará falhas ou engasgos no áudio**. O escalonador do FreeRTOS garantirá que a `audioTask` sempre receba tempo de CPU.
    *   Você pode usar `delay()` tranquilamente para aplicações simples. No entanto, saiba que delays muito longos (muitos segundos) ainda podem potencialmente disparar o Task Watchdog Timer (TWDT) do ESP32, o que pode causar uma reinicialização. Para aplicações complexas que precisam se manter responsivas, ainda é uma boa prática usar temporizadores não-bloqueantes com `millis()`.

*   **Erros de compilação sobre funções `i2s` ou `dac`:**
    *   O pacote de suporte à placa ESP32 na sua IDE do Arduino provavelmente está desatualizado. Atualize-o através do Gerenciador de Placas.
